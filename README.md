# BdsPp
A powerful Minecraft Server Soft.

## why?

|SoftName| Reason|
|:----|:----|
|PMMP|I hate PHP...|
|Bdsx| You're missing out a little bit. ......|
|Bds|Shit.|
|Nukkit| It's not being developed? Has it stopped being updated?|

## Features

It's not like some server software that uses Bds as is, but it's built from scratch. It is a server software that emphasizes knockback.
The language is javascript, which makes it easy to create plug-ins. I'm planning to write it in C++ if I want to.
